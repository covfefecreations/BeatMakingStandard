  "overview": {
    "definition": "Bass rhythm is the foundation that bridges harmony (what chords are being played) and rhythm (when beats occur). The bass line serves multiple critical functions:\n1. Harmonic Foundation: Defines chord roots and provides low-end frequency content\n2. Rhythmic Drive: Creates groove and forward momentum through note placement and duration\n3. Melodic Movement: Connects chords through stepwise or intervallic motion\n4. Space Management: Determines when to play and when to rest, leaving room for other elements\n\nA great bass line is felt more than heard—it should be the gravitational force that makes people move without demanding conscious attention.",
